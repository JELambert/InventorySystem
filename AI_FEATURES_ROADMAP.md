- "Find all warranty items expiring soon"

#### Implementation
```python
class NaturalLanguageProcessor:
    async def process_command(self, command: str) -> Action:
        # Parse intent using LLM
        # Extract entities and parameters
        # Generate executable action
        # Request confirmation if needed
```
