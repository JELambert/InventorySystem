# Home Inventory System Architecture Guide

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive architecture guide provides **practical, implementable solutions** for building a simple home inventory system using Streamlit, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Weaviate. The research reveals that **starting simple with proven patterns** is the most effective approach, focusing on a narrow vertical slice that works reliably before adding complexity.

**Key architectural decisions favor simplicity**: use Streamlit-Authenticator for robust authentication, implement a service layer pattern in FastAPI for clean database integration, leverage Docker Compose for deployment simplicity, and design data models that support both structured queries and semantic search without over-engineering.

The recommended approach emphasizes **incremental development** through three phases: basic CRUD functionality first, then enhanced features, and finally production-ready capabilities. This strategy minimizes technical debt while ensuring each phase delivers working software that can be deployed and used immediately.

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Authentication Strategy for Streamlit Frontend

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Context**: Home inventory system needs simple but secure authentication with session management for CRUD operations.

**Decision Drivers**:
- Single-user or small family use case
- Minimal complexity preference
- Session persistence across browser tabs
- Integration with FastAPI backend

**Considered Options**:
- Built-in Streamlit OIDC authentication
- Streamlit-Authenticator library
- Simple environment variable password protection

**Decision**: **Streamlit-Authenticator library**

**Justification**: Provides comprehensive authentication features without external dependencies, includes password hashing with bcrypt, session management with cookies, and password reset functionality. Offers the best balance of security and simplicity for small-scale deployment.

**Implementation**:
```python
# config.yaml approach with YAML-based user management
authenticator = stauth.Authenticate(
    config['credentials'],
    config['cookie']['name'], 
    config['cookie']['key'],
    config['cookie']['expiry_days']
)
```

**Positive Consequences**: Complete authentication solution, secure password handling, persistent sessions, minimal external dependencies.

**Negative Consequences**: Requires YAML configuration management, user registration handled manually rather than self-service.

### ADR-002: Database Architecture for Dual PostgreSQL-Weaviate Integration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Context**: System requires both structured inventory data management and semantic search capabilities.

**Decision Drivers**:
- Structured data for inventory tracking (quantities, locations, prices)
- Semantic search for item descriptions and categories
- External LXC database containers in Proxmox environment
- Data consistency requirements

**Considered Options**:
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension only
- PostgreSQL + Weaviate with dual-write pattern
- PostgreSQL + Weaviate with event-driven synchronization

**Decision**: **PostgreSQL + Weaviate with simplified dual-write pattern**

**Justification**: PostgreSQL serves as the authoritative source for structured inventory data, while Weaviate handles semantic search. **Dual-write approach provides immediate consistency** for small-scale systems without complex event streaming infrastructure.

**Implementation**:
```python
class InventoryService:
    async def create_item(self, item_data):
        # Write to PostgreSQL first (source of truth)
        db_item = await self.create_postgres_item(item_data)
        # Sync to Weaviate for search
        await self.create_weaviate_embedding(db_item)
        return db_item
```

**Positive Consequences**: Clear data ownership, reliable structured queries, powerful semantic search, simple consistency model.

**Negative Consequences**: Potential inconsistency if Weaviate write fails, slightly increased complexity compared to single database.

### ADR-003: API Design Pattern for FastAPI Backend

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Context**: FastAPI backend needs clean architecture for CRUD operations with dual database integration.

**Decision Drivers**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Database connection management
- Error handling for external databases

**Considered Options**:
- Direct database access in route handlers
- Repository pattern with dependency injection
- Service layer with dual database managers

**Decision**: **Service layer pattern with dependency injection**

**Justification**: **Service layer encapsulates business logic** while dependency injection enables clean testing and connection management. Pattern scales well and maintains clear boundaries between data access and business rules.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Dependency injection for dual databases
async def get_inventory_service(
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_postgres_session),
    weaviate_client = Depends(get_weaviate_client)
) -> InventoryService:
    return InventoryService(db, weaviate_client)

@router.post("/items/")
async def create_item(
    item: InventoryItemCreate,
    service: InventoryService = Depends(get_inventory_service)
):
    return await service.create_item(item)
```

**Positive Consequences**: Clean architecture, testable code, proper connection management, clear error boundaries.

**Negative Consequences**: Additional abstraction layers, more boilerplate code than direct database access.

### ADR-004: Containerization Strategy for Proxmox Deployment

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Context**: Deploy applications in Docker containers while databases run in separate LXC containers on Proxmox.

**Decision Drivers**:
- External PostgreSQL and Weaviate in LXC containers
- Proxmox homelab environment
- Simple deployment and updates
- Resource isolation

**Considered Options**:
- Single container with embedded databases
- Docker Compose with external database connections
- Kubernetes deployment

**Decision**: **Docker Compose with external database connections**

**Justification**: **Docker Compose provides simplicity** while maintaining separation of concerns. Applications in containers for easy updates, databases in LXCs for better resource management and backup strategies.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
services:
  fastapi:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@192.168.1.100:5432/inventory
      - WEAVIATE_URL=http://192.168.1.101:8080
  
  streamlit:
    build: ./frontend
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://fastapi:8000
    depends_on:
      - fastapi
```

**Positive Consequences**: Easy deployment, simple updates, resource isolation, database independence.

**Negative Consequences**: Network configuration complexity, external dependency management.

### ADR-005: Data Model Design for Inventory Management

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-06-30  
**Context**: Design data model supporting both structured inventory management and semantic search capabilities.

**Decision Drivers**:
- Home inventory use case with items, locations, categories
- Support for semantic search on descriptions
- Insurance and warranty tracking
- Many-to-many item-location relationships with quantity tracking
- Simple but extensible design

**Considered Options**:
- Flat table structure with JSON metadata
- Normalized relational model with separate tables
- Document-based model with embedded relationships
- Direct item-location foreign keys vs. inventory junction table

**Decision**: **Normalized relational model with inventory junction table**

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Enhanced implementation with comprehensive metadata
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    location_type location_type_enum NOT NULL,
    parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    color VARCHAR(7),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    item_type item_type_enum NOT NULL,
    condition item_condition_enum DEFAULT 'good',
    status item_status_enum DEFAULT 'available',
    brand VARCHAR(100),
    model VARCHAR(100),
    serial_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    barcode VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    purchase_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    current_value DECIMAL(10,2),
    purchase_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    warranty_expiry TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    weight DECIMAL(8,3),
    dimensions VARCHAR(100),
    color VARCHAR(50),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    notes TEXT,
    tags VARCHAR(500)
);

-- Inventory junction table for many-to-many item-location relationships
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id INTEGER REFERENCES items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    location_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(item_id, location_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX ix_inventory_item_id ON inventory(item_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_inventory_location_id ON inventory(location_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_inventory_updated_at ON inventory(updated_at);
```

**Positive Consequences**: 
- Clear many-to-many relationships with quantity tracking
- Hierarchical organization for both locations and categories
- Extensible design with comprehensive metadata
- Insurance-ready tracking with values and warranty information
- Efficient querying with proper indexes
- CASCADE deletes maintain referential integrity

**Negative Consequences**: 
- More complex than flat structure with direct item-location links
