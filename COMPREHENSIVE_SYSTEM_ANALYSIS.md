- Future: Consider React/Vue.js for Phase 3 if mobile becomes critical

### 2. **Frontend Bundle Size** (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Heavy dependencies (Plotly, Pandas) may impact load times  
**Impact**: Slower initial page loads  
**Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading for visualization components

### 3. **Database Connection Scalability** (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Single PostgreSQL instance for all operations  
**Impact**: Potential bottleneck under high concurrent usage  
**Mitigation**: Connection pooling configured, monitoring needed

### 4. **Error Recovery Complexity** (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Dual-database strategy (PostgreSQL + Weaviate) will require careful error handling
