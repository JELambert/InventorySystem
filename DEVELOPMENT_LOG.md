   - **Root Cause**: Version compatibility between SQLAlchemy 2.0.23+ and typing_extensions
   - **Solution**: Downgraded to SQLAlchemy 2.0.21 + typing-extensions 4.8.0
   - **Impact**: Tests now pass reliably

2. **Missing Greenlet Dependency**
   - **Problem**: `ValueError: the greenlet library is required to use this function. No module named 'greenlet'`
   - **Root Cause**: SQLAlchemy async functionality requires greenlet for coroutine support
   - **Solution**: Added `greenlet==3.0.1` to requirements-dev.txt
   - **Impact**: All async database operations now work properly

3. **Python Path Import Issues**
   - **Problem**: Tests failing due to module import errors
   - **Solution**: Created multiple test runners with PYTHONPATH configuration

  - Self-referential SQLAlchemy model with parent/child relationships
  - LocationType enum: HOUSE, ROOM, CONTAINER, SHELF
  - Full type annotations with SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped` pattern
  - Proper indexes on key fields (name, location_type, parent_id)
- **Hierarchical Functionality**
  - `full_path` property: generates "House/Room/Container/Shelf" paths
  - `depth` property: calculates hierarchy depth (0 = root)
  - `is_ancestor_of()` / `is_descendant_of()` relationship methods
  - `get_root()` method: finds top-level location in hierarchy
  - `get_all_descendants()` recursive method for tree traversal
- **Database Integration**
  - Automatic table creation with proper foreign key constraints
  - Cascade delete: removing parent deletes all children
  - Timestamps: created_at, updated_at with automatic updates
- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - 10 pytest test functions covering all functionality
  - Manual verification script with 8 test categories
  - String representation tests (__str__ and __repr__)

#### Challenges Faced & Solutions

   - **Solution**: Created helper function `_get_test_session()` with proper setup/teardown
   - **Impact**: All tests now run reliably with proper session handling

2. **Relationship Lazy Loading After Session Close**
   - **Problem**: Accessing parent/children relationships after session close causing DetachedInstanceError
   - **Solution**: Added explicit session.refresh() calls with relationship loading in tests
   - **Impact**: All tests resolved, 10/10 tests passing reliably

3. **Code Quality and Type Safety**
   - **Problem**: MyPy errors with SQLAlchemy Base class, flake8 line length issues
   - **Solution**: Fixed imports, reformatted with black, split long lines appropriately
   - **Impact**: Clean code quality checks (black ✅, flake8 ✅, minor mypy warnings acceptable for SQLAlchemy)

#### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Hierarchical Design**: 4-level hierarchy (House → Room → Container → Shelf) with flexibility for additional levels
- **Self-Referential Pattern**: Single table with parent_id foreign key, allows unlimited nesting depth
- **Cascade Strategy**: "all, delete-orphan" ensures clean deletion of location trees
- **Enum Design**: String-based LocationType enum for database compatibility and readability
- **Method Design**: Property-based path/depth calculation for clean API, method-based relationship queries

#### Current State
- ✅ Location model created and integrated with database

## Architecture Evolution

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Async-First Architecture**: Using async SQLAlchemy throughout for consistency
2. **Modular Model Design**: Each model independently testable and deployable
3. **Migration Strategy**: Alembic from start to handle schema evolution
4. **Test Strategy**: In-memory SQLite for tests, file-based SQLite for development

### Strategic Tech Debt Decisions

#### ✅ Completed in Steps 1.2d & 1.2e
1. **Database File Location**: Move from project root to `backend/data/` 
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Impacts deployment and organization
   - **Solution**: Configurable database path with environment variables
   - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Database files now properly organized

2. **Logging Infrastructure**: Add structured logging foundation
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Essential for debugging and monitoring
   - **Solution**: Centralized logging configuration with level management
   - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Full logging infrastructure implemented

3. **Database Configuration**: Enhanced connection and error handling
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves reliability and debugging
   - **Solution**: Better error messages and health checks
   - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Enhanced configuration and monitoring

4. **Alembic Migration System**: Database schema versioning
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Required before production
   - **Solution**: Full Alembic integration with management scripts
   - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Migration infrastructure fully operational

#### Remaining for Later Steps
1. **PostgreSQL Production Setup**: Production database configuration
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Required for deployment
   - **Timeline**: End of Week 1

2. **Connection Pooling**: Database performance optimization
   - **Priority**: LOW - Performance enhancement
   - **Timeline**: When performance issues arise

3. **API Rate Limiting**: Request throttling for production
   - **Priority**: LOW - Security enhancement
   - **Timeline**: Pre-production deployment

### Deviations from Original Plan
1. **Database Dependencies**: Started with SQLite instead of PostgreSQL due to system dependency issues
   - **Rationale**: Get development environment working quickly
   - **Impact**: No functional changes, easy to migrate later
   
2. **Requirements Splitting**: Created separate dev/prod requirements files
   - **Rationale**: Avoid compilation issues blocking development
   - **Impact**: More flexible dependency management

3. **Documentation Priority**: Created comprehensive documentation early
   - **Rationale**: Prevent knowledge loss and improve maintainability
   - **Impact**: Better development process, easier onboarding

### Lessons Learned
1. **Start Simple**: Minimal working setup first, then add complexity
2. **Dependencies Matter**: System dependencies can block entire development workflow
3. **Docker Fallback**: Always have containerized development option
4. **Test Early**: Code quality tools from project start prevent technical debt

## Development Philosophy Applied

### Small, Modular, Iterative Approach
- **Micro-Steps**: Each task broken into 30-60 minute chunks
- **Independent Testing**: Each component testable in isolation
- **Incremental Complexity**: Add one feature at a time
- **Validation Gates**: All tests and quality checks must pass before proceeding

### Success Metrics for Each Step
- Takes less than 1 hour to complete
- Produces working, demonstrable functionality
- Has comprehensive test coverage
- Passes all code quality checks
- Can be validated independently

### ✅ Poetry Package Management Migration
**Completed**: 2025-06-29  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: COMPLETE

#### What Was Built
- **Backend Poetry Configuration**: Complete migration from pip to Poetry with pyproject.toml
  - All dependencies migrated with proper version constraints
  - Development and production dependency groups
  - SQLAlchemy/greenlet compatibility resolved
  - Poetry scripts for common tasks
- **Frontend Poetry Configuration**: Streamlit application migrated to Poetry
  - All frontend dependencies managed through Poetry
  - Package mode disabled for application (not library)
  - Development workflow scripts integrated
- **Docker Integration**: Updated all Docker configurations for Poetry
  - Production and development Dockerfiles updated
  - Multi-stage builds with Poetry optimization
  - Full-stack docker-compose configuration
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive runbook and development log updates
  - Poetry command reference and cheat sheet
  - Updated emergency procedures
  - Legacy pip commands preserved as fallback

#### Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. **Python Version Compatibility**
   - **Problem**: Greenlet compilation failing on Python 3.13 due to internal API changes
   - **Solution**: Constrained to Python 3.12 with flexible dependency versions
   - **Impact**: Stable, deterministic builds across all environments

2. **SQLAlchemy Dependency Conflicts**
   - **Problem**: Version conflicts between dev and prod SQLAlchemy requirements
   - **Solution**: Used Poetry's flexible version constraints and dependency groups
   - **Impact**: Clean dependency resolution without manual workarounds

3. **Frontend Package Structure**
   - **Problem**: Streamlit apps don't need library packaging features
   - **Solution**: Used Poetry's `package-mode = false` setting
   - **Impact**: Simplified configuration focused on dependency management

#### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Unified Package Management**: Both backend and frontend use Poetry for consistency
- **Docker Strategy**: Poetry-based containers with optimized caching layers
- **Version Strategy**: Use flexible constraints (^) for better dependency resolution
- **Environment Strategy**: Poetry virtual environments managed automatically

#### Current State
- ✅ Backend runs successfully with Poetry (`poetry run uvicorn app.main:app`)
- ✅ Frontend runs successfully with Poetry (`poetry run streamlit run app.py`)
- ✅ All tests pass with Poetry environment (`poetry run pytest`)
- ✅ Docker containers build and run with Poetry
- ✅ Full-stack docker-compose configuration working
- ✅ All development tools work (black, flake8, mypy, pytest)

#### Benefits Achieved
- **Deterministic Builds**: poetry.lock ensures exact same dependencies across environments
- **Better Conflict Resolution**: Poetry's SAT solver handles complex dependency trees
- **Simplified Environment Management**: No more manual venv activation
- **Improved CI/CD**: Faster, more reliable builds with Poetry caching
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Single command for all operations

#### Migration Commands Summary
```bash
# Old pip workflow
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python script.py

# New Poetry workflow  
poetry install
poetry run python script.py
```

### ✅ Streamlit Configuration Fix
**Completed**: 2025-06-29  
**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Status**: COMPLETE

#### Issue Encountered
After Poetry migration completion, frontend accessibility issues occurred:
- 404 errors on port 8501
- "Site cannot be reached" on port 3000
- Streamlit showing conflicting port information in debug messages

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Configuration Conflict**: Streamlit's `developmentMode = true` setting was preventing manual port specification, causing:
1. **Port Assignment Conflicts**: Development mode auto-assigns ports, conflicting with manual port settings
2. **Inconsistent URL Display**: Debug logs showed "Server started on port 8501" but browser URL showed "http://0.0.0.0:3000"
3. **Runtime Error**: `RuntimeError: server.port does not work when global.developmentMode is true`

#### Solution Implemented
**Streamlit Configuration Update** in `frontend/.streamlit/config.toml`:
```toml
[global]
# Development mode settings
developmentMode = false  # Changed from true

[server]
# Server configuration
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8501  # Added explicit port specification
maxUploadSize = 1028
enableStaticServing = true
```

#### Verification Results
- ✅ **Frontend Accessibility**: http://localhost:8501 returns HTTP 200 OK
- ✅ **Backend Connectivity**: http://localhost:8000/health working correctly
- ✅ **Port Consistency**: Streamlit now consistently shows "URL: http://0.0.0.0:8501"
- ✅ **Service Independence**: Both backend and frontend start/stop independently

#### Technical Details
- **Before**: Development mode caused automatic port assignment with conflicts
- **After**: Fixed port assignment (8501) with production-ready configuration
- **Impact**: Reliable frontend access for development and deployment

#### Current Service Status
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 (uvicorn with Poetry)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit with Poetry)  
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

#### Additional Notes
- Backend locations API still shows 500 errors (separate issue for investigation)
- Frontend code has minor function signature issue (separate issue for investigation)
- Both services now start reliably with Poetry commands
