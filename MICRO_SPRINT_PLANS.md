## Micro-Sprint Overview

**Approach**: Small iterative tasks with continuous testing, documentation, and git commits at every step. Each micro-sprint delivers working, tested functionality.

**Quality Standards**:
- Mandatory testing and verification at each task
- Real-time documentation updates
- Structured git commits with technical details
- No batching of completed work

- Integration with existing search infrastructure

#### **Task 1B-6: Testing & Validation** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Verified backend API endpoint functionality (ItemCreateWithLocation working)
- Tested basic API endpoints (Items, Locations working)
- Frontend successfully accessible and functional
- Manual verification of core integration points
- Error handling tested and working

### Quality Gates
- ‚úÖ All new item creation goes through location assignment
- ‚úÖ Users can see which location items are stored in
- ‚úÖ Users can move items between locations
- ‚úÖ Quantity tracking works for all items
- ‚úÖ Existing items can be assigned locations
- ‚úÖ Error handling provides clear user feedback

### Files to Modify
1. `frontend/utils/api_client.py` - Add new endpoint method
2. `frontend/pages/05_üì¶_Items.py` - Update item creation form and add inventory management
3. `frontend/components/` - Potentially new inventory management components

### Success Criteria
- Items created through frontend automatically get assigned to locations
- Users can manage item inventory (location assignments, quantities)
- Item displays show location and quantity information
- Moving items between locations works seamlessly
- Form validation provides clear feedback
